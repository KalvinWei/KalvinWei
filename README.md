### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Kalvin Wei**, a software developer currently based in Auckland New Zealand. I'm working for TenX Limited, a company helping clients transforming their businesses with creative ideas and products.

I'm experienced in developing full-stack web apps with modern technologies and tools on AWS cloud.
I use Figma to do prototyping and hi-fi designs for my apps. I like to build apps with a design system and tokens bridging the design and dev.  
Recently, I'm learning to use React Native combined with Google Firebase to build scalable, multi-platform mobile apps.
